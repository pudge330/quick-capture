# Quick Capture 1.0

### Introdunction

Quick Capture is program I created earlier this year to use at my job as a wireless retailer. 
At my job we had to take screen shots of various steps in the sale process, save them to the computer and later upload them to the user's account via our POS system.

It wasn't a huge pain to take the couple extra steps. Hit the screen capture key, open paint, paste the image and save it under the customer's name.
But as being in school for software development I decided to try and make it a little easier on us there.

I'm still currently in school taking minimal classes at the time while working full time. So this is just version 1.0, I plan on updating it to be less resource intensive(avg 60-80mb) and fixing the graphics a bit. As I'm still learning those will be soon to come. Also will be changing the storage to a sqlite DB in the future instead of flat-file storage.
